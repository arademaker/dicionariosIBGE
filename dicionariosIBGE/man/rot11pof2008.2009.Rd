\title{Data Dictionary label for  book of outgoing record POF 2008-2009 survey}
\description{

  One data dictionary label for reading "T_CADERNETA_DESPESA_S.txt" file
  (book of outgoing (type 11) record from POF 2008-2009 survey).

  
  In this record we didn't use the variable \code{METODO_QUANTKG}
  (MÃ‰TODO DA QUANTIDADE ADQUIRIDA), because the label of de codes are to
  much extensive and there is more than one classification associated to
  it, so in order not to change the meaning of the labels adapting in
  the \code{rotulo} colummn, we excluded.

}

\format{
  This dictionary is a data frame with one line for each survey categorical variable,
